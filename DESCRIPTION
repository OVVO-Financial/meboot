Description: Maximum entropy density based dependent data bootstrap.
  An algorithm is provided to create a population of time series (ensemble)
  without assuming stationarity. The reference paper (Vinod, H.D., 2004
  <DOI:10.1016/j.jempfin.2003.06.002>) explains how the algorithm satisfies
  the ergodic theorem and the central limit theorem.
